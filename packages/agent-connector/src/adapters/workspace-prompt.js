 * Per-agent name for the workspace skill file.
 *
 * The skill used to be named plain `openagents-workspace` for every agent.
 * Two agents configured with the same working directory then wrote the SAME
 * skill file, and the `source: openagents:<name>` identity embedded in its
 * curl commands belonged to whichever agent wrote last — so files one agent
 * uploaded showed up attributed to the other. Namespacing the skill by agent
 * (as the OpenClaw adapter already does) keeps each agent reading only its
 * own identity even when working directories are shared.
 *
 * The result must satisfy the Agent Skills naming rules (lowercase kebab-case,
 * no consecutive/leading/trailing hyphens, max 64 chars) or the skill may not
 * be discovered at all. Agent names are looser than that (uppercase,
 * underscores, up to 64 chars), so normalization is lossy — and a lossy name
 * gets a stable short hash of the RAW name appended, because two distinct
 * agents converging on one normalized name (e.g. `My_Agent` and `my-agent`)
 * would silently reintroduce the exact shared-identity bug this prevents.
 *
 * Known, accepted limitation — the encoding is not closed: a verbatim legal
 * name can in principle equal another name's `<stem>-<hash8>` output (an
 * agent literally named `my-agent-3aa88293` collides with `My_Agent`).
 * Triggering it takes either a ~2^-32 accident or deliberately naming an
 * agent after another's hash — and whoever edits daemon.yaml on this machine
 * can already read every skill file and token directly, so nothing is gained.
 * Hashing EVERY name would close the gap but make all skill names carry a
 * hash suffix; readability of common names was chosen instead.

 *
 * The tool-reference block is emitted directly for the chosen mode so it can
 * never drift out of sync (previously the adapter string-replaced the MCP
 * block, which silently leaked stale MCP tool names when the list changed).
 *
 * `decisionLog` opts in to constraint pinning:
 * { enabled, state 'found'|'absent'|'unknown', entryId, content, writeAccess? }.
 * `glossary` opts in to glossary pinning: { enabled, entryId, content,
 * writeAccess? }. Both default to off — other adapters that reuse this
 * builder (e.g. Gemini) are unaffected unless they pass them.
